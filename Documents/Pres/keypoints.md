* Many platforms, too sparse: 
    * knowledge is not centralized
    * one course might have its own forum in its own university, making it unreachable for other students coming from other universities.  
    * have to adapt to a new system every time (mailing lists, moodle, Chamilo, Quora, Stack….)
* No one-in-all solution:
    * You have a  forum of discussion, an online announcement panel for schedules/exams/information, Facebook groups …. -> easily get lost
* Difficulty of finding a specific answer: 
    * the answers are often not directly related to the students course in his specific university
    * an old answer might just get lost in the web-forum itself
    * assistants / teachers won’t bother to answer a question that’s related to their course on all websites

* A centralized solution: 
    * bring all platforms together in a student-friendly way
    * all the knowledge in one place
    * Expliquer ce qu’on prend de chaque site
* Not what you’ve seen before:
    * not only a forum nor a Q&A website
    * designed for everyone
    * pas de hors sujet
* Persistence of Information
    * Once answered, never asked again
    * easy retrieval of information
    * easy to find on search engines

* Academic-oriented tree view architecture:
    * Sorted by universities, then majors, then courses
    * e.g : University of Geneva -> Computer Science -> Data Mining
    * e.g : University of Geneva -> Computer Science -> Administrative questions
* Q&As … 
* Reward-based system: 
    * upvote / downvote system
    * badge (bachelor student, master student, PhD, assistant….)
    * trophies (first accepted answer, 10 upvotes …. )
* Intuitive search engine:
    * Autocompletion of questions
    * tag search
